# C-CNN

## description

a small library to try and implement CNNs in C

it works with 2d data so it uses a matrix library (matrix.c + matrix.h)

## to do
### preprocessing
- resize
- transform images to 3 channel data
- read/write matrixes to files

### convolution layer
- dot product, h and v flip, ...
- add padding function
- backpropagation?

### pooling layer
- pooling functions (max, min, mean)

### connected layer
- probably MLP


lastly get everything running together

...

### extra
- further optimizization
- threads?
- binaries for python usage/syntax
